### A social media react application
This react application allows users to register and login to an account using Google's Firebase Authentication. Once logged in users can make a post. All posts are displayed with the most recent displayed first. The application was built styled using React Bootstrap and thus should be mobile responsive.

### Issues
If you find any issues feel free to mark them as such.

### Notice
This is public to anyone. I may have shared this application with friends who could have shared it with their friends and etc. Be warned there may be inappropriate or silly posts and they shouldn't reflect my beliefs or values.

This project was made simply to showcase my own programming abilities.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
